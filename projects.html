                    <h4>WOMEN BEHIND THE WHEEL</h4>
                    <p>The Women Behind the Wheel Program enables women to become independent not just in terms of transportation but for many other terms. This program offers 14 hours of paid, behind-the-wheel, expert driving training. Coupled with our case management support, this program will ensure that participating women not only learn how to drive, but that they are comfortable driving and obtain their driver’s licenses in a timely fashion.</br>
                      <p>    </p>
                      <b>Why do refugee and immigrant women need access to behind-the-wheel training and driver’s education?</b>
                      <p>Many women especially new immigrant women in our communities do not drive, which severely limits their ability to work, continue their education, learn English, keep appointments, as well as support their families. The inability to drive not only hold their transition to life in the U.S., but also creates stress on the immediate family.</p><p>   </p><b>Benefits</b><p>Education, Equal Access to Services, Employment Opportunities, and Individual and Family Wellness</p> </p>

                    <h4>CRISIS INTERVENTION </h4>
                    <b>Crisis intervention is an immediate and short-term emergency response to emotional, physical, mental, and behavioral distress</b>
                      <p>The Crisis Intervention Program serves to help families in their time of crisis and reduce the potential for permanent distress or trauma.</p>
                      <p>    </p>
                      <b>Why might families we serve need crisis intervention?</b><p>•	Most of new commers faced a wide variety of traumatic events. They may witness destruction, observe violent acts perpetrated against loved ones, endure torture and persecution, lost their homes, livelihoods, many of their possessions, and even loved ones.  
                        •	In addition to the hardships endured prior to being resettled, refugees and immigrants must learn how to acclimate to their new lives in the U.S. Although resettlement agencies play a vital role in this process, it is a temporary one usually lasting 3-6 months. The families are then left to fend for themselves, with minimal language fluency and cultural adaptation. Many struggle to maintain employment, assist their children with schooling, or adapt to their new lives. 
                        </p> 
                      <p>
                        •	The lack of language fluency, coupled with financial struggles makes it even harder when a family suddenly loses a loved one, has to deal with long term illness, is faced with an eviction notice, or can’t pay the bills. 
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        •	Giving Hands US strives to help these families in their times of crisis by addressing their immediate and evolving needs including emergent health issues, funeral arrangements, psychiatry evaluations, translation services, and financial assistance.

                    <p>•	 Most of the families we serve share common hurdles, all of them have unique needs. </p>
                    <p>•	Some have disabled children who may need help with their school’s Individualized Education Plan (IEP); others may have chronic or terminal illnesses. Some may need help finding their relatives who were not able to immigrate with them. </p>
                    <p>•	Our experienced case manager helps families renew their food stamps, apply for social security benefits and unemployment, and works intimately with clients’ respective resettlement agencies to best serve the families. </p>
                    <p>•	Families in need of case management must meet with Giving Hands staff and follow an intake process. Once completed, the family’s needs are addressed, and services are planned. Evaluation and periodic follow up are then crucial to make this process a successful one.</p>
